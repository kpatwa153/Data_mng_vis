# 📊 Health Data Analytics Using CDC County-Level Estimates  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project leverages **data analytics and visualization techniques** to extract insights from the **CDC’s comprehensive county-level health estimates (2020-2021)**. The goal is to identify **local health disparities**, detect emerging **public health concerns**, and propose **data-driven interventions** to improve **community well-being**.  

Through **data preprocessing, manipulation, and visualization**, this project highlights **risk behaviors linked to chronic diseases, health outcomes, disabilities, and health status indicators**. The findings aim to inform **targeted public health programs** and drive **policy changes**.  

## 🚀 Key Features  
✅ **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing** – Handling missing values, normalizing data, and structuring for analysis  
✅ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Identifying trends, distributions, and outliers in health indicators  
✅ **Data Visualization** – Graphical insights into state/county-level health disparities  
✅ **Pattern Identification** – Analyzing risk behaviors, chronic disease correlations, and regional health issues  
✅ **Public Health Policy Impact** – Providing actionable insights for targeted health interventions  

## 📂 Dataset  
- **Source:** CDC’s County-Level Health Estimates (2020-2021)  
- **Key Attributes:**  
  - **Health Outcomes:** Chronic disease prevalence, mortality rates  
  - **Preventive Measures:** Vaccination rates, health screenings  
  - **Health Risk Behaviors:** Smoking, obesity, physical inactivity  
  - **Disabilities & Indicators:** Functional impairments, overall health scores  

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools Used

- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Statistical Analysis & Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn  

## 📊 Data Analysis Workflow  
1️⃣ **Data Collection & Preprocessing** – Cleaning and transforming raw CDC data  
2️⃣ **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Detecting health disparities across counties/states  
3️⃣ **Visualization & Interpretation** – Mapping insights through charts & graphs  
4️⃣ **Pattern Recognition & Policy Suggestions** – Identifying critical public health trends  

## 🎯 Findings & Impact  
- **Health Disparities:** Significant variations in chronic disease prevalence across counties  
- **Preventive Measures:** Certain states showed lower vaccination/screening rates, signaling intervention needs  
- **Behavioral Trends:** Correlations between risk behaviors and worsening health outcomes  
- **Policy Recommendations:** Data-driven insights for **targeted public health programs**
